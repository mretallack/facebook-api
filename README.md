# Facebook Automation API

A comprehensive REST API for automating Facebook interactions using Playwright. Supports posts, friends, groups, messages, events, pages, marketplace, and stories.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING: Profile Timelines Show Comments, Not Posts

### Evidence-Based Discovery

**What the scraper actually extracts**: Comments that the user made on other people's posts, NOT the user's own posts.

**Proof**:
```bash
$ python test_different_urls.py

Main profile (https://www.facebook.com/mark.retallack):
  Articles found: 3
  Has comment_id: True  ← This indicates a COMMENT
  Has post link: True   ← Link to the post being commented on
  Text: "Chris Retallack..."  ← Comment text

Posts tab (https://www.facebook.com/mark.retallack/posts):
  Articles found: 0  ← Privacy restricted, returns empty
```

**Screenshot Evidence**:
- Main profile: 1.2MB (shows comments)
- Posts tab: 50KB (empty/blocked)

### ✅ Direct Post Access WORKS (If You Have the Post ID)

**Discovery**: You CAN access individual posts directly if you know the post ID:

```bash
$ python test_direct_post_access.py

Testing: https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10160189910976167&set=a.10153685248131167
✓ Page contains 'Mark Retallack'
✓ Image viewer found
✓ Content accessible
```

**Post URL Formats That Work**:
```
https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=POST_ID&set=ALBUM_ID
https://www.facebook.com/USERNAME/posts/POST_ID
https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=POST_ID&id=USER_ID
```

**The Challenge**: Finding post IDs without scraping the profile
- Profile timeline doesn't show post links (only comments)
- Posts tab is privacy-restricted
- Need alternative method to discover post IDs

**Possible Solutions**:
1. **News Feed Scraping** - Extract post IDs from your own feed
2. **Notification Scraping** - Get post IDs from notifications
3. **Graph API** - Use official API to get post IDs
4. **Historical Database** - Build database of post IDs over time

### Why This Happens

Facebook's profile timeline (`/username`) shows **recent activity**:
- ✅ Comments the user made
- ✅ Posts the user was tagged in
- ✅ Reactions the user made
- ❌ NOT the user's own posts

To see actual posts, you need:
1. **Direct post URL** - **Works if you have the post ID** ✅
2. **Posts tab** (`/username/posts`) - **Privacy blocked** for friends ❌
3. **Graph API** - Requires app approval + user OAuth consent
4. **News Feed** - Shows posts that appear in your feed

## Technical Deep Dive: How Facebook Renders Posts

### Executive Summary

Facebook uses **client-side JavaScript rendering with virtual scrolling**. Posts are NOT in the initial HTML source - they're created dynamically by JavaScript after the page loads. The only reliable way to extract posts is **DOM extraction during scrolling**, which is what this scraper implements.

**Key Finding**: Profile timelines yield 10-16 posts maximum due to Facebook's virtual scrolling design, not scraper limitations.

---

## Evidence-Based Analysis

### 1. Initial Page Load Analysis

**Test**: View page source vs rendered DOM
```bash
# Initial HTML size
curl -s 'https://www.facebook.com/mark.retallack' | wc -c
# Result: 2,482,784 chars

# Search for post text in source
grep -o "Do not give Ben J20" page_source.html
# Result: 0 matches (post text NOT in HTML source)

# Search in rendered DOM
page.query_selector_all('[role="article"]')
# Result: 2 articles initially, grows to 8 during scroll
```

**Evidence**: Post content exists only in rendered DOM, not in initial HTML.

---

### 2. Virtual Scrolling Behavior

**Test**: Monitor article count during scrolling
```python
Scroll 0:  2 articles in DOM
Scroll 5:  3 articles in DOM
Scroll 10: 5 articles in DOM
Scroll 15: 8 articles in DOM
Scroll 20: 2 articles in DOM  # Old posts REMOVED
```

**Evidence**: Facebook removes old `[role="article"]` elements as new ones load. Article count fluctuates, proving virtual scrolling.

**Technical Details**:
- DOM selector: `[role="article"]` for post containers
- Text selector: `[dir="auto"]` for post content
- Virtual DOM removes articles after ~10 new posts loaded
- Maximum ~20 posts in DOM at any time

---

### 3. GraphQL Network Analysis

**Test**: Intercept all network requests during profile load
```bash
# Captured GraphQL requests
x-fb-friendly-name: "CometNotificationsDropdownQuery"
x-fb-friendly-name: "fetchMWChatVideoAutoplaySettingQuery"
x-fb-friendly-name: "FBYRPTimeLimitsEnforcementQuery"
x-fb-friendly-name: "useMWEncryptedBackupsFetchBackupIdsV2Query"

# NO timeline/feed queries found
```

**Evidence**: Profile pages do NOT make GraphQL requests for timeline posts. GraphQL is only used for notifications, settings, and messenger features.

**GraphQL Request Structure** (for reference):
```http
POST https://www.facebook.com/api/graphql/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

av=61586881541300
fb_dtsg=NAfvScOYsQLzCdKX5aAd3go8WvMQiaq1LRz6ptJpGn-V40LPdNBc-tw:2:1769418649
doc_id=25044355701909548
variables={"count":15,"environment":"MAIN_SURFACE","scale":1}
```

**Parameters**:
- `fb_dtsg`: CSRF token (extracted from page HTML, changes per session)
- `doc_id`: GraphQL query identifier (hardcoded, changes with Facebook updates)
- `variables`: JSON parameters (URL-encoded, not encrypted)
- `av`: Actor/user ID

**Response Format**: JSON (not encrypted)
```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "message_capabilities2_str": "107945653871116544",
      "id": "61586881541300"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Embedded JSON Analysis

**Test**: Search for JSON in page HTML
```bash
grep -o '"__bbox"' page.html | wc -l
# Result: 164 occurrences

# Extract and parse embedded JSON
# Found: Profile metadata, settings, UI state
# NOT found: Timeline posts
```

**Evidence**: Page HTML contains JSON for configuration and metadata, but NOT for timeline posts. Posts are rendered by JavaScript after page load.

---

### 5. DOM Extraction Success Rate

**Test**: Run scraper on multiple profiles
```bash
$ python test_friend_posts.py
Scroll 0: 0 posts so far
Scroll 5: 2 posts so far
Scroll 10: 4 posts so far
Scroll 15: 5 posts so far
Scroll 20: 8 posts so far

Total posts: 10
1. A lovely new year's day...
2. Great pic love Santa...
3. Wonder what three sons do for you...
```

**Evidence**: DOM extraction successfully retrieves 10-16 posts per profile, which matches Facebook's virtual scrolling limit.

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Extract during scroll (not after)
for i in range(30):
    articles = await page.query_selector_all('[role="article"]')
    for article in articles:
        # Check if post or comment
        links = await article.query_selector_all('a[href*="facebook.com"]')
        has_comment_id = any('comment_id' in href for href in links)
        
        # Extract text
        text_elements = await article.query_selector_all('[dir="auto"]')
        text = max([await elem.inner_text() for elem in text_elements], key=len)
        
    await page.evaluate('window.scrollBy(0, 300)')
    await asyncio.sleep(1.5)
```

---

### 6. Comment vs Post Detection

**Test**: Analyze article link patterns
```python
# Comment indicators
'comment_id=123456' in href  # Has comment_id parameter

# Post indicators  
'/posts/' in href            # Direct post link
'/permalink/' in href        # Permalink to post

# Logic
if has_comment_id and not has_post_link:
    skip  # This is a comment on someone else's post
```

**Evidence**: Links containing `comment_id` without `/posts/` or `/permalink/` are comments, not posts. Scraper filters these out.

---

## Why You Can't Get "All" Posts

### Technical Limitations

1. **Virtual Scrolling Design**
   - Facebook intentionally limits to ~20 posts in DOM
   - Old posts removed as new ones load
   - No "load more" button - infinite scroll with removal

2. **Privacy Architecture**
   - Full post history requires Graph API with permissions
   - Profile timeline shows "recent activity" not "all posts"
   - `/username/posts` tab returns "content isn't available" for friends

3. **Anti-Bot Detection**
   - Aggressive scrolling triggers rate limiting
   - Session expires after ~5 minutes without activity
   - Headless browser detection (mitigated with stealth mode)

4. **API Access Requirements**
   - Official Graph API requires app approval
   - Needs user OAuth consent
   - Rate limited to 200 calls/hour
   - Only returns posts user has permission to see

---

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Initial articles | 2 | First render |
| Max articles in DOM | 8-10 | Before removal |
| Posts extracted | 10-16 | Per profile |
| Scroll iterations | 30 | Optimal balance |
| Time per scroll | 1.5s | Includes wait for render |
| Total scrape time | 45s | For one profile |
| GraphQL requests | 7-10 | None for timeline |
| Session duration | 3-5 min | Before refresh needed |

---

## Alternative Approaches Tested

### ❌ GraphQL Interception
**Attempted**: Intercept GraphQL responses for timeline data  
**Result**: Profile pages don't make timeline GraphQL requests  
**Evidence**: Only 7 GraphQL requests captured, all for notifications/settings

### ❌ JSON Extraction from HTML
**Attempted**: Parse embedded `<script type="application/json">` tags  
**Result**: No timeline data in embedded JSON  
**Evidence**: 164 JSON objects found, none contain posts

### ❌ Direct API Calls
**Attempted**: Replicate GraphQL requests with captured tokens  
**Result**: No timeline query endpoint identified  
**Evidence**: `doc_id` for timeline queries not exposed on profile pages

### ✅ DOM Extraction (Current Implementation)
**Method**: Extract from rendered DOM during scrolling  
**Result**: Successfully retrieves 10-16 posts per profile  
**Evidence**: Proven working in production

## Recommendations

### For Getting Actual Posts (Not Comments)

**The Reality**: You cannot scrape a friend's actual posts from their profile.

**Why**:
1. Profile timeline shows comments/activity, not posts
2. Posts tab (`/username/posts`) is privacy-restricted
3. Facebook intentionally blocks this for privacy

**Alternatives**:
1. **Official Graph API**
   - Requires Facebook app approval
   - User must grant OAuth permissions
   - Rate limited to 200 calls/hour
   - Only returns posts user has permission to see

2. **News Feed Scraping**
   - Scrape your own news feed (`/`)
   - Will show friends' posts that appear in your feed
   - Limited to what Facebook's algorithm shows you

3. **Group Posts**
   - If user posts in public groups
   - Scrape the group, not the profile

4. **Page Posts**
   - If user has a public Page
   - Pages are scrapable (not privacy-restricted)

### For Current Implementation (Comments)

The current scraper successfully extracts:
- ✅ Comments user made on posts
- ✅ 10-16 comments per profile
- ✅ Filters out nested replies
- ✅ Session keep-alive prevents expiration

If you need actual posts, you must use Facebook's official Graph API with proper permissions.

---

## Recommendations (Original)

### For Maximum Post Coverage
1. **Use official Graph API** - Requires app approval and user consent
2. **Scrape multiple sections** - Profile, photos, videos, tagged posts
3. **Historical scraping** - Run daily to build post history over time
4. **Multiple accounts** - Rotate to avoid rate limiting

### For Current Implementation
- ✅ DOM extraction is the correct approach
- ✅ 10-16 posts per profile is expected behavior
- ✅ Session keep-alive prevents expiration
- ✅ Comment filtering ensures quality data

from src.scraper.session_manager import SessionManager

# Create session manager
session = SessionManager()

# Start account 1
await session.start("account1")
await session.login("email1@example.com", "password1", "account1")

# Start account 2
await session.start("account2")
await session.login("email2@example.com", "password2", "account2")

# Switch between accounts
page1 = await session.switch_account("account1")
page2 = await session.switch_account("account2")

# Get specific account page
page = session.get_page("account1")
```

## Rate Limiting

The API automatically enforces rate limits per account:

- Friend requests: 15/hour
- Posts: 8/hour
- Messages: 40/hour
- Likes: 80/hour
- Comments: 30/hour

## Caching

Responses are cached with TTL:

```python
from src.core.cache_manager import cache

# Set cache
await cache.set("key", "value", ttl=300)  # 5 minutes

# Get cache
value = await cache.get("key")

# Delete cache
await cache.delete("key")

# Get stats
stats = cache.stats()
```

## Queue Management

Priority-based async task queue:

```python
from src.core.queue_manager import queue, Priority

# Enqueue task
task_id = await queue.enqueue(
    "task1",
    my_function,
    args=("arg1",),
    priority=Priority.HIGH,
    account_id="account1"
)

# Start queue
await queue.start()

# Get task status
status = queue.get_status(task_id)

# Get stats
stats = queue.stats()
```

## GraphQL Interception

The API intercepts Facebook's GraphQL responses for more reliable data extraction:

```python
from src.core.graphql_extractor import GraphQLExtractor

extractor = GraphQLExtractor()
await extractor.intercept_responses(page)

# Navigate to page
await page.goto(url)

# Extract profile data
profile = extractor.extract_profile()

# Save responses for debugging
extractor.save_responses('/tmp/graphql.json')
```

```

## Security

- Store credentials in `.env` file (never commit)
- Cookies are stored per account in `cookies/` directory
- Add `cookies/` and `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement API key authentication for production use

## Rate Limits & Best Practices

1. **Respect Facebook's Terms of Service**
2. **Use reasonable delays between actions**
3. **Don't exceed rate limits**
4. **Use residential proxies for production**
5. **Implement proper error handling**
6. **Monitor for security checkpoints**
7. **Keep cookies fresh (re-login every 25 days)**

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues

- Check credentials in `.env`
- Delete old cookies: `rm cookies/*.json`
- Disable headless mode: `HEADLESS=false`
- Check for security checkpoints

### Rate Limiting

- Reduce action frequency
- Use multiple accounts
- Implement longer delays

### Selector Failures

- Facebook UI changes frequently
- Check logs for failed selectors
- Update selectors in code
- Use GraphQL interception when possible

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
python3 tests/test_core_infrastructure.py

# Start with debug logging
DEBUG=true python3 -m src.api.main

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## API Health Check

```bash
GET /health

Response:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "browser_ready": true
}
```

## Limitations

- **Login Required**: Most features require authentication
- **Privacy Settings**: Can only access public data or data visible to logged-in user
- **Rate Limits**: Facebook enforces strict rate limits
- **UI Changes**: Facebook frequently changes UI, requiring selector updates
- **GraphQL Restrictions**: Profile data limited for logged-out users
